            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The 2001 Honda Prelude was renowned for its precise and balanced handling, thanks to several key features that enhanced its performance on the road. It was equipped with a double wishbone suspension in both the front and rear, providing excellent stability and cornering capabilities, especially during sharp turns and high-speed driving. The rack-and-pinion steering with power assist offered responsive and precise feedback, making it easy to maneuver in various driving conditions, while its tight turning diameter of 36.1 feet allowed for agility in city driving and parking. The braking system featured ventilated disc brakes in the front and solid discs in the rear, ensuring consistent stopping power, and the addition of ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) provided greater control during emergency braking. The Prelude's stock tire size, 205/50 R16, balanced grip and comfort, further improving cornering performance by offering excellent road feedback. Its near 60/40 weight distribution between the front and rear contributed to stable and predictable handling, particularly when cornering at higher speeds. Stabilizer bars in both the front and rear reduced body roll, giving the car a firmer, more controlled ride. Together, these features made the Prelude a favorite among driving enthusiasts for its well-engineered chassis and exceptional handling.</p>
